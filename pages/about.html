        <h1>HISTORY OF DIGAWANA</h1>
        <img src="../assets/imgs/history.jpeg" alt="History" width="650" height="250">

        <p>
            Digawana is the capital city of a country called Botswana which is located in the Southern part of Africa.
            Digwana, which was formally known as Digauneng was proclaimed the capital city of Botswana after the country
            gained independence form the British government on the 30th of September 1966. The history of Digawana comes
            from way back before the gaining of the independence.
        </p>
        <p>
            Way before Digawana was declared the capital city, a certain man by the name of Digaung Digawaneg who was
            known for his anger issues and was a survivor of the world war 1 resided in the by then very big yet almost
            empty village, it had a range pf about 25-30 people and loads of ploughing fields as that was the only way
            the people of the village were able to provide for themselves and their families.
        </p>
        <cd cdp>
            Over the years the numbers of people living in Digawana gradually increased with people of different\ tribes
            who found Mr Digaung Digawaneng as the chief of the Bangwaketse of Digawana.

            <h2>Spoiler alert!</h2>
            Just like there are two sides of a coin, so is Digawana! There is the corporate side where there are very
            large buildings where important business meetings are held , where the high court and government offices are
            situated and there is the jugle-ish side of the city. Where new discoveries are constantly made and where
            curiousness meets adventure day in day out without fail.
